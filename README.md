I wrote down answer and best execution time for each code at the bottom  
Please notify me when you are going to use part of my codes in your programs.  
  
**Update** solution to Problem 31 has been uploaded.  

Unsolved : 44   
Solved but inefficient :   
  
Inefficient solutions will not be posted until they are finally revised.  

**Spoiler Alert**  
Don't look up the solutions before you actually try them by yourself!  
This blog suggests one of many different possible ways to solve problems,  
but looking at solutions before trying wouldn't be worth anything.
